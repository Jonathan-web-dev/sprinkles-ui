#Testing

## Guidelines and Practices

In order to ensure a stable codebase for all users, we expect all new code to be backed by tests. Please follow the guidelines before.

* Run existing tests

```sh
$ npm run test
```

* Write new unit tests located in the tests directory. We use Jest for testing
* Please update the visual representation of the component in the UI Harness (located in specs directory)
  * Add documentation
  * Add/update any relevant specs

Please, before submitting a pull request make sure tests pass. Feel free to create an issue and ask for help if needed.
