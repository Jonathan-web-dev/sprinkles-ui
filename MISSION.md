# Mission

Creation of a UI component library in React that is easy to use and can be used to jumpstart the creation of a website or web application.

## Philosophies

* **Code quality is key** - We believe in cleanly written code. This mean all pull requests must go through code review of peer engineers. We favor clarity and consistency over terse and confusing.
* **We strive for maintainable code** - enforced through automated tests and peer engineers' watchful eyes.
* **We are all humans** - As such, we agree to a simple [code of conduct](./CODEOFCONDUCT.md).
* **Everyone's input is important** - We encourage you to [participate in our project](./CONTRIBUTING.md). We cannot guarantee we will always agree but we value every input. _"Discourse is fleeting, but junk mail is forever." - Joe Bob Briggs_
