# Contributing

## Reporting issues and suggesting features

We are open to any suggestions or bug reports. Please open an issue in Github and we'll take a look at it. If you feel inclined to fix it yourself, create a PR and much thanks in advance!

## Working on code

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch for your changes
2. Hack on code!
3. [Create and run tests](./TESTING.md), all passing? Sweet!
4. Rebase your changes against master (as necessary).
5. Commit your code using the Commitizen command line utility. [See install instructions](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/), once installed use 'git cz' instead of 'git commit'
6. Send a pull request

## General development notes

We use linters as much as possible to keep code clean. Linters will automatically run when creating a commit. Tests will run when pushing up a branch.
